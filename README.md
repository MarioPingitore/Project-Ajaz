<h2>Application of Big Data techniques and machine learning
algorithms on environmental data using Weka and Apache
Spark</h2>
</br>
<h3>The first step of the project is to analyze the supplied dataset on Weka, to better understand how the tool works
and to get informations about the classification and clustering algorithms that after we apply to our dataset.
Data have been sensed and collected from the environment, enriched with infos coming from a well-known
weather webservice and used to produce a .csv dataset. This dataset has been then examined using Weka tool
in order to find interesting patterns and eventual correlations. The project also implements a machine learning
algorithm, run on an Apache Spark server, whose purpose is to enable fault-tolerance for the system. In fact, if
some fail from some sensors happens, with consequential data loss, the system will exploit this algorithm, trained
with the dataset composed by previous readings, to predict the value of the missed reading.</h3>
